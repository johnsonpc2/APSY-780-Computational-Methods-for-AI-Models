## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository
2. Install Python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run tests: `python -m pytest tests/`

## Development Environment

This project is configured to work with Spyder IDE. The `.spyderproject` and `.spyproject` files are ignored in version control to prevent conflicts between different development environments.

## Usage

To generate the results from the project files I have uploaded, all you need to do is download the files, run the scripts, and data CSVs and plots will be generated and saved to the "~/src/1 - Stroop Basics/output" directory.

NB: You may need to create the directories in order for the plots and data files to be generated; however, I have alos uploaded those with my script file, so you can look at them either way.
